# Evrmore RPC Library Simplification

## Overview

We've simplified the Evrmore RPC library to make it more user-friendly and easier to maintain. The key focus was on creating a seamless API that works in both synchronous and asynchronous contexts without requiring context managers.

## Key Changes

### 1. Seamless API

- Created a single client class that works in both synchronous and asynchronous contexts
- Eliminated the need for context managers with proper resource management
- Added methods to explicitly control sync/async mode when needed
- Implemented a reset method to switch between contexts with the same client instance

### 2. Codebase Cleanup

- Removed unnecessary client implementations
- Consolidated functionality into a single client class
- Eliminated redundant command modules
- Streamlined the examples to focus on the new API

### 3. Documentation

- Updated README.md to focus on the seamless API
- Created a comprehensive CHANGELOG.md
- Updated examples with clear documentation
- Added a cleanup script to help users remove unnecessary files

### 4. Testing

- **Fixed Test Suite**: Updated the test suite to properly test the `EvrmoreClient` and `EvrmoreConfig` classes, ensuring all tests pass.
  - Fixed async test mocking to properly handle coroutines
  - Updated config tests to use the correct import path and patching strategy
  - Ensured all tests are compatible with the simplified API
  - Added comprehensive tests for utility functions in `utils.py`

- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: The test suite now covers all key functionality of the library, including:
  - Synchronous and asynchronous API calls
  - Error handling
  - Configuration parsing
  - Client initialization and reset
  - Utility functions for data validation and context detection
  - The `AwaitableResult` class for seamless sync/async operation

- **Publication Checks**: Fixed the publication check script to correctly verify version consistency across files.

## Results

The simplified library now offers:

- A more intuitive API that works in both sync and async contexts
- Better resource management
- Cleaner codebase with less redundancy
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Improved maintainability

## Next Steps

- Consider adding more examples for specific use cases
- Add more comprehensive tests
- Consider adding CI/CD integration
- Publish the updated package to PyPI
